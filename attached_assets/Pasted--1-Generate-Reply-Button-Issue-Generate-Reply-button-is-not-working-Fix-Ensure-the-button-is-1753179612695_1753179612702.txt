✅ 1. Generate Reply Button
Issue:
"Generate Reply" button is not working.

Fix:
Ensure the button is properly bound to its event handler. Implement loading and error handling logic.

Action Steps:

Verify the front-end click event triggers the correct function.

Check API endpoint or LLM call used behind the button.

Add fail-safe UI feedback if API is unreachable or returns error.

Action Steps:

Integrate platform APIs (or scraping methods where APIs are limited).

Tooltip for platform-specific metrics (e.g. Quora “Upvotes”, Twitter “Retweets”).

Bonus Tip:
Use local storage/session for keys if app is browser-based and user-controlled.

Fix:

Add checkbox or toggle: “Enable In-Depth Search”
